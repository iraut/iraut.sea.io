<h1>Save the Oceans</h1>
<h2>Say no to Plastic!</h2>

<p>Who doesn't love the beach? Probably some people, but let's be honest, very few doesn't. The ocean is mainly the whole Planet Earth, it can't be ignored, it can't be destroyed.</p>

<p>There are many alternatives to stop ocean pollution. Really, there is really no excuse for the excuses. We all need to do our part, all of us. We want our kids to be able to enjoy and appreciate our beautiful waterworld.</p>

<p>Recycling isn't the only option, it's just an excuse to keep using the wrong materials. It sure is better than nothing, but what's even better than nothing is nothing at all. 0 plastic, 0 pollution.</p>

<p>Hello! My name is Ingrid and I have a mission. To inspire others to save our oceans, to create new materials innovation that will naturaly decompose and to spread the message around the Planet.</p>
